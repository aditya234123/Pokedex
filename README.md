# Pokedex

The goal of this project was to create an application similar to a Pokedex where users can search for 
pokemon and get information about them.

# Features

The app begins with the following screen:

Here you are able to search either specifically for individual pokemon, in which case you would use the search bar,
or for more general categories of pokemon. You are able to search for pokemon by name or number.

This screen is an example of a possible search.

You can toggle the search between a list view and a grid view.

If you select a certain pokemon here, you are then brought to a profile page for that pokemon. Here you can see all 
of the facts about that pokemon. You also have the ability here to add this pokemon to your favorites, in which case it will
save it locally, or search the web for it.

If you search the web, the following screen opens.

And if you are to add it to favorites, you can access the favorites tab from the first screen of the application. There the 
selected pokemon are layed out and you can click them to again see more about them.
